# Module 4 - Containerized Development With Volumes

#### A note about the semantic formatting in this tutorial:

- [ ] Check boxes are steps that need to be completed.

Text that looks `like this --for --example` are commands that you should type into your terminal. Or else.

---
>Asides: Side notes to ponder while staring off into the distance.

---

**Bold text: Gotchas that are gonna getcha if you don't heed this advice**

**Click on an image if you need a larger view**

## With that out of the way, let's get started!


- [ ] Using the `cd` command in your terminal - navigate to the '/4-Containerized_Development_With_Containers' directory

---
>Feel free to check out the app that we'll be developing in our containerized environment. Similar to the previous Module, this application is also a server. Rather than serving a random number, however, it will serve a webpage with a background color defined by the string on line 12 of 'index.js'
>
>Open up the Dockerfile and notice that two things have changed from the last Dockerfile we worked with:
>
>First, the `EXPOSE 8080` command; containers built from this image will expose port 8080 rather than 3000 like last time
>
>Second, we are building our image off of a different version of the official node image. Rather than `:latest`, we are using `:8.10-alpine`. 
>
>"This image is based on the popular Alpine Linux project, available in the alpine official image. Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general. This variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired." -- [Official node image on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/)
>
>I posed the question at the end of the last module, "Why might it be a bad idea to use the `:latest` version of an image?". The answer is that because a big part of what makes containers great is their consistency - they run the same everywhere. If we build two images at different points in time and the `:latest` base image version is different between builds, this has the potential to introduce variance in containers that we would otherwise expect to be identical. 
>
>The `:8.10-alpine` version will always refer to a node image that is built with node.js version 8.10 under the hood. Because knowing is better than not knowing.

---

- [ ] Bundle our app into an image tagged with the name 'colorserver' by running `docker build -t colorserver .`

**Docker will pull the 'node:8.10-alpine' image down from Dockerhub in order to complete the build. Notice how much faster the pull went compared to 'node:latest'. This is due to the 'alpine' version being so slim**

- [ ] Spin up a new container based on the 'colorserver' image you just built, mapping it to port 8080 on the host. Run `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 colorserver`

- [ ] Open up your browser and visit `localhost:8080`. Notice that the color of the web page is 'SteelBlue'.

- [ ] Now, pretend you are in a development environment and want to quickly test out several different colors to see which one looks best. Open up 'index.js' and change the color on line 12 from `'SteelBlue'` to the string `'SpringGreen'`

- [ ] Refresh the webpage in your browser. Just as you expect the webpage to present you with a calming pastel shade of green, your heart sinks as your eyes are assaulted with same cold, hard shade of steel blue.

**This will never do;** it would seem that if you want to use containers in your development, every time you make a change to the code you have to take the following steps: Change the code -> Build an image with your code -> Stop and remove the old container -> Remove the old image -> Spin up a container from the new image -> See if you like the change

**Obviously, if you had to do all this, no one would ever use Docker for Development.**

**Enter Volumes...**

---
>"Docker volumes are free-floating filesystems. They don't have to be connected to a particular container. "  -- Docker Docs
>
>A simple explanation of volumes is that it is a way for a containers to interact with the host's filesystem. This is useful in several situations; persisting data that you don't want lost if the container were to stop unexpectedly, as a communication method between otherwise isolated containers, and (as in our case) having our container reference rapidly changing source code on our host.

---

- [ ] We can take our already-built colorserver image and use the ` -v` option to mount a volume. The ` -v` option expects two arguments after it. First, the path to the directory you want the spun-up container to reference, and second, the path to the directory inside the container where you want those file changes to be reflected (separated by a colon)

- [ ] Reading that, you might think that running the command `docker run -d -p 1000:8080 -v ./:/src/app colorserver` would work, right? A relative filepath seemed to work okay for the `COPY` command inside the Dockerfile! And when using the `docker build` command! But you get the following message: 

```sh
$ docker run -d -p 1000:8080 -v ./:/src/app colorserver
docker: Error response from daemon: create ./: "./" includes invalid characters for a local volume name, only "[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]" are allowed. If you intended to pass a host directory, use absolute path.
See 'docker run --help'.
```
**As the error message implies, the first argument of the ` -v` option needs to be an absolute path to the directory in question**

- [ ] How do you find the absolute path? Well do I have good news for you! As long as you are cd'd into the directory that you want the absolute path to (in this case the directory with the app's source code), just run the command `pwd`

`pwd` stands for 'print working directory' and it does just that. Mine looks like:

```sh
/Users/Dylan/Desktop/Please-Contain-Yourself/4-Containerized_Development_With_Volumes/
```

How about yours??

- [ ] With that tidbit of information in hand we can mount a volume successfully. Spin up a detached container based on the 'colorserver' image, which is named 'psychic_container', which is mapped to port 1000 on the host, which has a volume mounted in the directory with the application's source code.

That's a monster of a command. Mine will look like this:

```sh
docker run -d -p 1000:8080 -v /Users/Dylan/Desktop/Please-Contain-Yourself/4-Containerized_Development_With_Volumes/:/src/app --name psychic_container colorserver
```

**Again, yours will look different depending on the path you got from `pwd`**

- [ ] In your browser, go to `localhost:1000` in a new tab. You should notice something amazing... the page is the color 'SpringGreen'! **The container you just spun up reflects a change made in the app's source code that was not present when the image was built!**

- [ ] Test to make sure that updating the application's source code updates the code running in the container by changing the color variable in 'index.js' to the string 'red'

- [ ] Make sure you save the file and then Refresh the `localhost:1000` page. 

- [ ] The page is now RED! GET PUMPED!!

- [ ] Do this however many times you fancy. check out this [web color](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp) resource and go wild.

> This idea that containers change conflicts with a previously established idea - that our containers preserve their state as long as they are running. In the previous module, the random number that was assigned our app only changed when we restarted the container. We do not have to restart our container in this case because our application is configured to restart our server (rather than the container) when it detects changes in its source code. The tool used to do this is called 'nodemon' and is very useful in development whether or not you use containers. It saves developers the hassle of manually restarting their application to see the changes they just made. You can check out [the nodemon docs here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) for more information.
>
> **That being said, nodemon is not the best tool to use inside containers. To work inside a container, it has to use it's legacy polling setting which is rather CPU intensive. It is used in this Module and the next for demonstration purposes, but after that it is best to just restart the container to if your app needs to restart to reflect source code changes in the mounted volume.**
>
>**For this reason especially, make sure you stop these containers when done with them.**

---

**Now, I have to admit, typing out that massive filepath when defining where to mount the volume was a PAIN.** Luckily, there is an easier way! You can use `$(pwd)` in the argument list to ` -v` when running a container and `$(pwd)` will evaluate to the current working directory! No more typing that monster `docker run` command!

- [ ] Let's practice. I want you to use `$(pwd)` to spin up a detached container based on the 'colorserver' image, which is named 'psychic_container2', which is mapped to port 2000 on the host, which has a volume mounted in the directory with the application's source code.

Such a command should look like:

```sh
docker run -d -p 2000:8080 -v $(pwd):/src/app --name psychic_container2 colorserver
```
I like the looks of that a lot better!

- [ ] In a new tab in your browser, go to `localhost:2000`, miraculously the page will be red (or whatever your most recent change was), just like the server running on 'localhost:1000`. 

- [ ] This makes sense because they are both using application code from volumes mounted in the same directory. Change the color variable in 'index.js' one final time. 

- [ ] Save the file. Check out the page served by 'psychic_container' and 'psychic_container2'. They should both reflect the new color.

- [ ] Take a final peek at the container run without a volume on `localhost:8080`. It should still be steel blue.

>**The ability to set up a development environment this easily is immensely useful and powerful.** Not only is it fast and easy, but you don't have to install or configure a single dependency on your machine to get started. This means you can immediately get started working on a codebase that might use python, or apache, or postgreSQL even if you are not familiar with these tools, and might take hours or days setting them up on your machine otherwise. 
>
>Imagine the time and hassle you could save the next person to work on your code base if you just include a Dockerfile with the project! All that person needs to do is build an image from that Dockerfile - then that image can be spun into a container with a development environment identical to the one you used, no surprises! 

Just spin up a container with a volume mounted with the source code and get working on the code base immediately!

---




One additional docker command that I want to touch on in this Module is `docker logs`. When containers are detached and running in the background, if it logs something inside the container, you can't see it. `docker logs <container-name>` reveals everything that has been logged inside the container so far.

- [ ] Try it out, run `docker logs psychic_container`. you will see the following message logged for every time the app's source code was changed and the server restarted:

```sh
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node index index.js`
listening on port 8080...
```

NEAT!

- [ ] MAKE SURE YOU STOP AND REMOVE THOSE CONTAINERS WHEN YOU ARE DONE WITH THEM! (`docker rm -f <container-name(s)>`)

- [ ] Images are a big memory sink in Docker. Run `docker images`, then run `docker images -a`. The `-a` flag shows all the untagged images that come with building other images, and just look at how much memory they are using in the 'SIZE' column!

- [ ] That's why its a good idea to clean up un-needed images too. The memory usage can really add up. Remove the 'colorserver' with docker `docker rmi colorserver` then check out `docker images -a`. 

- [ ] Clean up any other un-used images the same way and bask in all the memory you just saved!

---
>Final notes before wrapping up: this process is only suitable for development, once you are happy with the container that is spun up with your application's modified source code, you will need to build a new image that bundles the final version of your source code into said image. For example, let's say you finally settled on the color purple for the background. You need to change it to 'purple' in your source code and run `docker build -t final_colorserver .` or something of the like. THAT image is now ready for production. (Also, like I mentioned above, you would want to change the start script to NOT use nodemon. That was just for demonstration purposes)

---

- [ ] An with that, Module 4 is complete. Don't forget to clean up your running containers, you crazy kids!

- [ ] When you're ready, the next module awaits... [Module 5](https://github.com/dylanlrrb/Please-Contain-Yourself/tree/master/5-Make_Multiple_Containers_Work_Together) - Make Multiple Containers Work Together
